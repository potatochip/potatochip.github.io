Python includes an incredibly userful module for data storage called pickling. I made a function to grab webpages from a website all at once and store them in a pickle so that you don't have to continuously toll the server.

Some nerdy-hilarious highlights from my module

* Module name: Brinery (like, binary, get it?)
* Main fuction: brine_time
* Unpickle function: debrine
* Error Flag: Sour pickle!
* List of errors: Sour pickle jar
