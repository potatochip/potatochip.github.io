title: Keyboard Math Layer
tags: [Nerd-out, metis]
---

I got tired of hunting for math symbols in the mac character viewer during the math portions of class, so I decided to create a math layer on my keyboard using Karabiner. So now, when I hold right-option and press 'i', I get the ∩ (intersection) character. When I press 'u', I get the ∪ (union) character. So handy!

If someone wants to save me from having to type in all the unicode keys alone, feel free to join in on [my github](https://github.com/potatochip/karabiner_keyboard_math_layer).
