I've started work on showing the change in the use of weapons and tactics in the Syrian Civil War. I whipped up a quick graph illustrating the trend for different causes of death over time.

You can see a broad overview of what is happening. The inverse correlation for 'Gun Shots' and 'Refusal to Follow Orders' for two obvious spikes is particularly interesting. But it is hard to understand the finer details. So I moved the concept to an interactive D3 visualization instead.
