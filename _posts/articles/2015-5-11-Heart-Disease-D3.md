This was the first time I tried my hand at D3. Pretty nifty stuff, but the real magic of D3 is that the tiniest, most unexpected things break EVERYTHING.

This is an illustration of different heart disease prediction models. At its base, it just shows the accuracy of each individual feature. Click some rows and the accuracy (and representative shading) changes to show how the combination of features affects the models.

I'm sorry about the disgusting iframe. [Click here to view the whole thing in all it's glory.](http://bl.ocks.org/potatochip/raw/35ae6d3e12e83a7d488b/)
