おっす！ようこそ！いらっしゃ〜い！

I like long walks on the beach, holding hands and python list comprehensions.

### Data Scientist and law refugee

I used to be a lawyer working on high-profile antitrust cases for Japanese companies. Then I decided to return to my original passions of computer science and data exploration and went back to school for data science.

In my spare time, I race track bikes. I'm aiming to win the track national championships in 2016. My lady is jealous of my VO2max.

When I grow up, I want to be like [Neil deGrasse Tyson](http://twitter.com/neiltyson).
