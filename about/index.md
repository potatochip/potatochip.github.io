### Data Scientist and law refugee

I used to be a lawyer working on high-profile antitrust cases for Japanese companies. I returned to my original passions of computer science and data exploration and went back to school for data science.

In my spare time, I race track bikes. I'm aiming to win the track national championships in 2016.

### Other information
I like long walks on the beach, holding hands and python list comprehensions.
